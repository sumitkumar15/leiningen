If you don't provide a repository name to deploy to, either \"snapshots\" or
\"releases\" will be used depending on your project's current version. You may
provide a repository URL instead of a name.

See `lein help deploying` under \"Authentication\" for instructions on
how to configure your credentials so you are not prompted on each
deploy.

You can also deploy arbitrary artifacts from disk:

    $ lein deploy myrepo com.blueant/fancypants 1.0.1 fancypants.jar pom.xml

The repository can be defined in defproject or a profile, or it can be a URL.
Use file://$HOME/.m2/repository to install in the local repo.

While this works with any arbitrary files on disk, downstream projects will not
be able to depend on jars that are deployed without a pom."
